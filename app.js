//  Note breakdown: The code first specifies constants that reference different HTML elements, such as buttons for numbers, operators, equals, and clear, as well as a display area. It then uses querySelectorAll to select all elements with a specific class and querySelector to select the first element with a specific ID or class.

// After that, the code declares variables currentNumber, previousNumber, and operator to keep track of the user's input and the operation to be performed. 

// Event listeners are then added to the number and operator buttons. When a number button is clicked, its value is added to the currentNumber variable and displayed. When an operator button is clicked, the operator is set to the clicked operator, previousNumber is set to currentNumber, and currentNumber is reset.

// An event listener is also added to the equals button. When clicked, it calls the calculateResult function with previousNumber, currentNumber, and operator as arguments. The function then calculates the result, displays it, and stores it in the currentNumber variable. The previousNumber and operator variables are reset.

// Another event listener is added to the clear button. When clicked, it resets currentNumber, previousNumber, operator, and the display.

// The calculateResult function takes two numbers and an operator as arguments. It converts the numbers from strings to floats, performs the operation specified by the operator, and returns the result. If the operator is not recognized, it returns 'Invalid operator'.
